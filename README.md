# TLDR
I built a plugin for koreader that lets you browse, search for, and download pdf and epub books from the library of congress digital collections directly to your ereader. Put it in the koreader plugins directory and give it a whirl. The UI can get a bit wonky, but it's not bad for a few hours' work. Developed on a 2019 intel macbook pro and tested on my old jailbroken kindle paperwhite running koreader v2025.10. Enjoy.
